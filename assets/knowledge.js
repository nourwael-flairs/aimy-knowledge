   knowledge.js — AiMY Knowledge v2

   One surface. The URL is the state, and the only state: every filter, the
   open document, and the view mode live in it, which is what makes the page
   drivable by an agent as well as by a person.

   The input is not a chat box. It routes on the shape of what was typed, into
   one of four classified entry modes:

     filter-like     → mutates the URL, the grid refilters      · direct
     a known title   → opens that document in place             · direct
     a question      → opens the canvas with a grounded answer  · investigate
     a write         → stages a commit surface, changes nothing · review

   Prototype scope: there is no backend. The corpus, the user, the source
   health and the timings are fixtures. Everything that would be a platform
   capability is simulated at the seam where it would really sit.

     CLIENTS, AND THE PRODUCTS THEY OWN

     Three kinds of product, which is why one flat list could not hold them:

       OWNED       a client's own product line. InterFAX belongs to Upland and
                   to nobody else, so choosing another client must take it off
                   the list rather than leave it there reading zero.
       STANDALONE  owned by no client. Always offered.
       AiMY        Copilot, Sales and Voice — ours, not a client's. Always
                   offered, always last, whichever client is chosen.

     Ownership is DECLARED here because it is a fact about the world, not a
     pattern in the corpus: InterFAX would still be Upland's if no document
     mentioned it. That is the opposite of the client↔product COUNTS, which are
     derived, and the two do different jobs — ownership decides which products
     are on the list, counts say how much is behind each one.

     Upland's fourteen are the real list from the console. The other five
     clients' products are PLACEHOLDERS, named to the same convention, and
     should be replaced when the real lists arrive.

     Two oddities carried over from the console rather than tidied away: it
     lists `valsoft` twice — one client, listed once here — and it has both a
     client called Asteris and a standalone product called `asteris`. They are
     different axes, so the slug collision is harmless, but it is the kind of
     thing that is a data-entry artifact and worth confirming.

     THE GRAPH

     This corpus has always been one. Every document carries typed edges — to a
     collection, a source, an owner, a client, a product, a region, its tags —
     and the product has only ever rendered them as filter dropdowns. That is
     the string reading of the data: `client` is a column and `nordwind` is a
     value in it. The other reading is Google's — things, not strings — where
     Nordwind is a thing with four documents, a success story, two tickets and
     an owner hanging off it.

     Nothing new is stored to get that. What changes is that the edges become
     addressable in both directions, and that an edge can say where it came
     from.

     TWO KINDS, and the distinction is the whole design.

     IMPLICIT edges are the fields themselves. They are derived, always true,
     cost nothing, and nobody asserted them — so nothing claims anybody did.

     ASSERTED edges are claims: this contradicts that, this replaced that.
     Somebody or something said so, and the edge carries who and when. That is
     Glean's point about edge properties, and it is the rule this product
     already holds for status — a computed fact and a claimed one must never
     look identical — finally applied to relationships too.

     THE FILTER ROW

     The filters are controls, not just an outcome of typing. Someone who does
     not know the vocabulary can still narrow the surface, and someone who does
     can see what the vocabulary contains.

     This is also how AiMY reports what it understood. Typing "expired ICPs in
     emea" lights up Type, Status and Region — a prose restatement underneath
     was only ever needed because the controls were invisible.

     `.v2-dropdown` is the system's only select control and carries the whole
     keyboard model. It is strictly single-select and its change event only
     reports the label, so the machine value rides on `data-slug` and is read
     off the selected option rather than parsed back out of the label.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════ */
  const opts = (obj, order) => (order || Object.keys(obj)).map((k) => [k, typeof obj[k] === 'string' ? obj[k] : obj[k].label]);

  /* ── Five, and the reason the other nine left ──

     There were fourteen controls: five here, six behind a *More* disclosure,
     plus the date range, *Mine* and *More* itself. Measured, their intrinsic
     width came to 1146px in 991px of row — it had never fitted, which is what
     the disclosure was for.

     A filter can leave the row without leaving the product, because the input
     already speaks all of it. Checked against LEX before removing anything:
     status all seven, type all nine, source all five, client all four, product
     all three, region, service and audience complete, the date windows, `mine`
     and `archived`. Every key removed is typeable today. The only gap was
     `collection` — policies, support and marketing are in the lexicon and sales
     and legal are not — and collection stayed, so nothing lost reach.

     What stays is what you narrow by before you know what you are looking for:
     where it lives, what it is, what it is ABOUT, and when it moved. Everything
     else is a question about the set, and a question belongs in the thing that
     answers questions.

     Product and Client are that third clause, and they came back for it. They
     are not questions about the set — they are the ground a reader is already
     standing on when they arrive: someone who works one account and someone who
     works one product both begin by cutting the corpus down to theirs. And
     typeable is not the same as reachable. The four client slugs and the three
     product slugs appear nowhere else on the surface, so the lexicon could only
     be spoken by someone who already knew the words — which is the test the
     removal was supposed to apply and, for these two, got wrong.

     They cost far less room than the disclosure they replaced. Settled with
     Urbanist at 1536: the five controls measure 433.55px of the 1160px row
     while empty, and 641.65px carrying the longest value on every axis — one
     line either way, 461px still clear before *Clear*. The row wraps rather
     than overflows below that, reaching three lines on a 390px phone, where
     the tray and the input are the way in anyway.

     `work` is not migrated because it never worked: the key is absent from
     LIST_KEYS, so serialize never wrote it and parseParams never read it, and
     applyFilters has never mentioned it. Six options that filtered nothing. */
  /* ═══════════════════════════════
     ALL FOUR TAKE MORE THAN ONE ANSWER

     `.v2-dropdown` is strictly single-select and its panel closes on choose.
     Neither is a bug: it is the library's only select control, and it was the
     right one for Collection and Type for as long as those were believed to
     take one answer each. They are not. "Policies OR Legal" and "Tickets OR
     Articles" are the same shape of question as "Upland OR CXS", the URL has
     stored a LIST per axis since the beginning, and the chip bar has always
     been able to name several — the control was the only part that could not
     say it, and a control that can only say one thing quietly teaches that only
     one thing can be asked.

     So the row has one kind of control now rather than two. Four multi-selects
     and the date range, which is the odd one out for a real reason: WHEN is a
     range, not a set, and four windows on one axis is a contradiction rather
     than a union.

     So this is a product extension standing beside the library's dropdown, not
     a fork of it, on the same reasoning the date range was: it borrows the
     panel's shape and the search field, adds the checkbox, the group heading
     and *Select all*, and is recorded in GAPS.md as the multi-select the system
     does not ship. Nothing here reaches into `.v2-dropdown`, so the library's
     keyboard model and close-on-choose stay exactly as they were for the
     controls that want them.

     The panel is rendered OPEN from module state rather than toggled by a
     class, because choosing a value writes the URL and a write repaints the
     row — a panel owned by the DOM would close on every tick. `calOpen` solved
     the same problem for the calendar and this follows it.

  /* ── Keeping the pair answerable ──

     Client and Product are not independent, and not simply nested either. A
     client-owned product belongs to exactly ONE client, so `client=CXS` with
     `product=Kapost` is not a narrow question — Kapost is Upland's, and the
     pair can only ever return nothing. The other half of the vocabulary is the
     opposite: Copilot is ours and answers under every client, so choosing it
     implies nothing about whose the document is. The corpus says the same —
     twelve documents pair a client with an AiMY product against seven with the
     client's own — so treating Client as a master and Product as its detail
     would be wrong more often than right. These rules touch OWNED products
     only.

       a chosen product puts its owner in the client filter
       dropping a client drops the products it owns

     Both sit out while no client is chosen, because an empty client filter
     excludes nobody and there is nothing to contradict. That is what keeps
     "I just want Kapost" from lighting up a client nobody asked for.

     Worth knowing which way round the trouble actually arrives, because it is
     not symmetrical. Choosing the client first cannot produce the bad pair —
     scoping has already taken the other clients' products off the list, so
     there is nothing wrong left to press. It comes from the other order:
     choose Kapost while the row is open, then add CXS. The one exception is a
     client that owns nothing at all, where the list falls back to every owner
     and a foreign product is reachable again. Both routes land in the same
     rule.

     What this is NOT is a reset. Clearing Product whenever Client changed was
     the obvious fix and the wrong one: it makes the row ORDER-DEPENDENT, so
     client-then-product would land somewhere other than product-then-client,
     and a filter is a set of conditions rather than a sequence of moves.
     Nothing here removes anything the reader did not remove themselves.

     It runs on interaction only. A link that arrives already contradicting
     itself is left alone — rewriting what a link asked for is the one thing
     the URL contract does not allow — and `productGroups` keeps the orphan
     listed under its owner so it can still be taken off. */

     DATE RANGE — the design system's .cal, given two ends

     The library ships `.cal` as a single-date month calendar: head with two
     nav buttons, a seven-column grid, and `.muted` / `.today` / `.selected`
     days. Every one of those parts is used here unchanged. What it does not
     ship is a RANGE — there is no start, no end, and nothing to draw the days
     between — so those three states are added as a product extension and
     recorded in GAPS.md rather than quietly forked.

     The trigger is the same `.v2-dropdown-btn` the other filters use. A filter
     row where one control looks foreign is worse than one that is slightly
     less literal about what opens underneath it.

     Both shapes live in the same URL key: `updated=30d` is a rolling window and
     `updated=2026-06-01..2026-07-30` is a fixed range. The tokens stay because
     chat writes them ("updated this year") and because a rolling window is a
     different question from a fixed one — "the last 7 days" keeps meaning the
     last 7 days tomorrow, and a range does not.

     THE RAIL — and where the briefing went

     There was a *Since Thursday* block at the top of this rail: five findings
     in severity order, each with an action. It has been removed, and nothing
     it said has been lost.

     The reason is that it was the SECOND place saying it. `AiMY noticed` sits
     directly above the grid, reads the same needsYou() model, and says the
     same findings better in three respects — it is in the first person, its
     figures land on the sets they count, and it re-derives against whatever
     you have filtered to instead of announcing the whole corpus at you. Two
     panels computing one model on one screen is not redundancy the reader can
     use: it is the same news twice, and the rail's copy was the weaker of the
     two while occupying the more valuable column.

     One entry was NOT in needsYou(): *You were last reading X*. That is not a
     finding, it is a bookmark — it belongs with the recents below rather than
     at the head of a list of problems, and USER.recent already carries it.

     What is left in the rail is what is only here: the filters you have
     already composed, and the state of the sources feeding the corpus.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════ */
  /* Questions that arrived and found nothing. Rows rather than a sentence, so
     the count is derived and a corpus with no gap can say so — a real condition
     and an unreachable one while the number was written into the copy.

     THE BELL — what is still waiting on a person

     The rail says what CHANGED since Thursday. The bell says what is still
     OUTSTANDING, which is a different question and the only one worth putting
     a dot on the chrome for: a source that came back and a document that was
     published both leave the rail's story true and this one's false.

     Both read the same model, so the two can never contradict each other, and
     neither is a hand-written list that survives what it describes being
     fixed. The bell it replaces carried a hard-coded "3 notifications" and a
     red dot with nothing behind it — a count that is always three is not a
     count, and a dot nothing can clear is not a signal.

     Every row ends somewhere real, and which route it takes is the row's own
     business: a single report opens that document, a set becomes the surface,
     a question goes to the canvas. That is the same four-route contract the
     input bar honours, so the panel is not a fifth way to do things.

     This computed the whole corpus and only ever rendered into the bell and

     looking at while they decide what to do — carried two bare counts and no
     interpretation of either, which is the "lonely insight" doctrine §1.1
     forbids, sitting on the busiest surface in the product.

     One argument fixes that. Called with a list, every finding is computed
     over THAT list, so the band above the grid re-derives as you filter and is
     about the set in front of you rather than about the corpus in general.

     TYPE BODIES — the one zone that varies

     The library's spec is eight templates over one fixed governance row, and
     the only zone it varies is the body. This card kept the collapse of
     METADATA onto one dim line — that was right and it stays — but shrank the
     body to a single truncated fact, which is what left eight types looking
     alike: an 11px icon halfway along a five-item line was carrying the whole
     distinction.

     Differentiation is by SHAPE. The library forbids carrying type in colour,
     and the zone's position is fixed on all eight, so texture is the channel
     left — and it is the one that survives a glance. A coloured pill over a
     sentence does not read like a row of tags, which does not read like a
     monospace URL, which does not read like a ruled quotation. Nobody has to
     read the label to know which is which.

     `full` is the document, which has width the card does not and can afford
     the rows the card clamps away. ONE table for both, so the grid and the
     opened document cannot describe the same object differently — the rule
     TYPE_FACTS was written under, applied where it actually holds.

     Two rules this table is written to, both checkable against the corpus:
       · A fact earns space only if it VARIES within its type. `src` is zendesk
         for six tickets out of six and hubspot for three ICPs out of four —
         zero information there, real information on an article or a blog.
       · Never restate the meta line. Status, owner, edited and used are tier
         three. Repeating one here is the five-row card coming back.

     Class attributes are whole static literals, never interpolated: the
     audit's scanner (css-audit.js:30) skips any `class="…"` holding a `$`, so
     a composed class would leave every variant unchecked.

  /* ── Three tiers, not five rows ──

     The card used to stack a type row, a status pill, a title, two identically
     styled facts and an owner: six runs, four of them within 3px and two of
     them byte-identical, so it read as a grey ladder with a bigger rung in the
     middle. What every list of this kind settles on — GitHub's issue rows,
     Linear, Gmail, Notion's database cards — is the opposite rule: metadata
     collapses onto ONE dim line and never becomes rows that compete.

     So: the title first and alone, one line of the document's own words under
     it, and everything else — status, type, owner, last use — on a single
     middot line at 11px. Each tier differs from its neighbour in at least two
     of size, weight, colour and position, which is what makes the hierarchy
     legible without a single label.

     What changed since: tier two is the TYPE's body rather than one truncated
     fact. The collapse was never the problem — the problem was that collapsing
     the metadata took the type's own content down with it, and eight kinds of
     object ended up sharing one sentence shape. Three tiers still, and the
     middle one now says something different per type.

     One footer, not two. The library's card ends with a bordered, tinted
     `.tc-gov` strip followed by a bordered `.tc-action` strip holding a
     full-width button — two rules and a banner where one row does the job. */

  /* ══ WHAT AiMY NOTICED ABOUT THIS SET ══════════════════════════

     What stood here first was `.rm-disclosure`: two numbers, *4 not used in
     answers* and *3 unowned*, with no interpretation, no severity and nothing
     to click. Doctrine §1.1 has a name for that shape — "a metric without an
     interpretation is merely a number wearing office clothes". It became three
     stacked rows, which fixed the interpretation and the action but still read
     as a panel the product had rather than as something AiMY said.

     This is AiMY QA/Sales' `Since your last visit` block, ported. The form is
     the argument: ONE first-person paragraph with the figures pressable inside
     it. "I looked at 12 documents. Two things need you: 3 disagree with each
     other, and 2 are behind their source." A list of findings is a report; a
     sentence in the first person is somebody telling you what they found, and
     the second is what AiMY is.

     Provenance is carried the way Sales carries it — the mark first in the
     head, the accent wash on the panel, first-person voice, and an accent
     underline on every figure. No badge and no "AI" wordmark: a thing that has
     to label itself AI is a thing that does not read as AI.

     A figure lands on exactly the set it counts. That is Sales' rule for
     `.slv-n` and it is the whole reason the numbers are pressable rather than
     bold — each one runs the finding's own `go()`, which is already one of the
     four endings §1.2 allows.

     Nothing here is a new finding. `needsYou()` has computed all eight since
     the bell was built; they were simply never shown over the corpus. Passing
     it the filtered list is the mechanism: filter to Conflicting and the
     paragraph narrows to the conflict, because it describes what you filtered
     to rather than announcing the corpus at you.

     THREE, hard. §5.1 asks for "a small, prioritised set of insights rather
     than an inventory", and the inventory is directly underneath — it is the
     grid. p1 before p2 before p3, which is the order needsYou() returns.

     Nothing to say renders nothing. There is no all-clear state, because a
     line that says everything is fine is a line you learn to skip, and then
     you skip the line that was not fine. */
  const INS_MAX = 3;
  const INS_COUNT = ['', 'One', 'Two', 'Three'];

  /* ── The finding is the target, not the digit ──

     Sales' rule for `.slv-n` is that what you press is the SIZE OF THE SET YOU
     LAND ON, and that rule is kept. What was wrong was the HIT AREA it was
     implemented with: one glyph, about 8px wide, carrying the only route from
     a finding to the documents it is about. Everything else in the clause —
     the noun, the verb, the whole statement of what is wrong — was inert text
     you could click straight through. A target that small also cannot be seen
     as a target across a paragraph; the underline reads as emphasis until you
     happen to be over it.

     The whole clause is the control now. *6 documents have not updated since
     their source stopped syncing* is one target that lands on those six, and
     the underline is drawn under all of it rather than under the digit: an
     affordance around 8px of a run you can press 300px of tells the reader the
     words are inert, which was the remaining half of the same defect. The
     figure keeps its weight and its tabular numerals, which is what makes it
     scan as a figure; it stops being the only marked thing in a clause it does
     not own.

     The division of labour is unchanged: the clause filters to exactly the
     documents it counted, and the action underneath is where the AI answer
     lives. Show me them, then do something about them.

     A finding with no ids counts something that is not a document — a coverage
     gap counts questions nobody could answer — so there is nothing to land on
     and the clause is not a control at all.

     ── Why a span and not a button ──

     A clause is a run of words in the middle of a sentence and has to break
     across lines like one. A `<button>` cannot: `display: inline` is not
     honoured on form controls, the box stays atomic, and the paragraph treats
     the whole clause as one unbreakable object. Measured at 260px — the text
     before it ended at x=469 and the clause started at the paragraph's left
     edge 21px lower, so *Three things need you:* sat alone on its own line
     with the clause dropped underneath it. Invisible at desktop width, wrong
     at every width below it, and the rail renders this band at 320px.

     So it is a span carrying the button role, with `tabindex` and an
     Enter/Space handler doing what the element would have done for free. That
     is the deal `role="button"` always is: you take the semantics and you owe
     the keyboard. Paid below, next to the click router that already routes
     `data-ins-n`. */

     THE TREE — the graph, walked one edge at a time

     A second view, not a second product. Whatever the filters say is what the
     tree contains, so switching between grid and tree keeps your place and
     changes only the shape of what you are looking at.

     The hierarchy used to be hard-coded Collection → Type → document, which is
     one traversal of a graph that has ten implicit edge types, frozen. It is a
     **grouping**
     now, and every axis in the list is an implicit edge type: grouping by
     client is walking the `about` edge, grouping by owner is walking `ownedBy`.
     A folder view over a knowledge graph is not a filing cabinet, it is a
     choice of which relationship to see the corpus through, and `?by=` is
     where that choice lives.

     Three things make it a graph rather than a re-sort. The group headers are
     entities — the name opens the peek, so a folder can tell you what it IS.
     Documents with no value on the axis get their own honest group instead of
     being dropped. And each document carries its asserted edges on the line
     beneath it, so the connections are visible in the structure rather than
     one click away inside each document.

     Built on the library's `.tree`, which is native <details>, so it needs no
     state of its own and survives a re-render open.

     THE PEEK — a thing, opened where you found it

     Entity pages were the obvious answer and the wrong one: a route per client
     would put back the destinations this whole build spent ten passes removing.
     So the graph surfaces in place. Click any entity anywhere and a panel opens
     anchored to it, carrying what it is, everything connected to it, and what
     you can do about it. Click a connection inside the panel and you are on the
     next thing, with a back arrow — traversal without ever leaving the page you
     were reading.

     `.cite-preview` is the library's hovercard and is the right look, but it
     cannot be the mechanism: it is `position: absolute` against a `.cite-wrap`
     parent and its open state is `:hover` on that parent. A panel that can be
     anchored to an owner's name in a card footer, a source in a rail and a row
     inside itself needs fixed positioning and a click. Recorded in GAPS.md.

  /* ── Unsaved changes ──

     Editing used to be its own commit: every keystroke and every field wrote
     through to the object, and the only thing the page said about it was a
     grey "Saved just now". That is autosave, and autosave has no answer to the
     two questions people actually ask of a document they are changing — "is
     this written down yet" and "can I take that back". There was no back: the
     write had already happened, in the corpus, under the search, in front of
     everybody the collection is shared with.

     So the writes still land on the object — the whole editor renders FROM the
     object, and buffering every field would mean a second copy of the document
     and two places for it to be wrong — but they are no longer a commit. The
     state the document was in when the round of edits started is kept whole,
     and the two ways out of a round are both offered, both explicit, and one
     of them has to be taken before the document can be left.

     `snap` is that state: a full clone, because a document is plain data and
     there is nothing in it a clone cannot carry. Restoring assigns back INTO
     the same object rather than swapping it, so every array in the corpus that
     holds this document keeps holding this document. */

  /* ── The body as it was drawn ──

     A document does not arrive as a page. Most of the corpus stores a summary
     and no markup at all, and the editor renders that into paragraphs — so
     writing an untouched body back to the object replaced a one-line summary
     with the renderer's own output and set `html` on a document that never had
     any. Nobody edited anything; the renderer caught up with itself. That was
     invisible while it was autosaved the instant it happened. Offer a Save and
     it stops being invisible: putting the pointer in the body and taking it
     out again announced unsaved changes to a document nobody had touched.

     So renderDoc records what it put in the body, and the body's writer
     compares against THAT rather than against the object. Nothing moved,
     nothing is written — which is also what stops `html` from collecting a
     layer of the template's whitespace on every focus.

     `bodyWritten` closes the one hole in that: once this round HAS written the

     ── The field is NAMED, not narrated ──

     This panel used to read as sentences — *Owned by N. Wael*, *Filed in
     Support*, *About no client*, *It is an Article*. The argument was that a
     phrase says what a label cannot. In a 320px column of nine facts it does
     the opposite: every row opens with a different function word, so the left
     edge no longer aligns on anything a reader can scan, and the eye has to
     parse a preposition before it reaches the fact. *About* is also the
     weakest word in the product — it is a preposition, an editing verb and a
     rail heading, and none of the three tells you the row holds a client.

     So the lead is the field's NAME and the value is the value: *Client:
     Nordwind GmbH*. Nine rows that start with a noun, one colon, no grammar to
     agree with. The sentence reading is not lost — it moves to where a
     sentence earns its keep, which is the graph: an edge still reads *Belongs
     to CXS* in the connections rail, because there the phrase IS the
     relationship rather than a label wearing one.

     Consequently `blank` is *None* and not *no client*: a sentence-completion
     under a label reads as a value called "no client". The colon comes from
     `.props .prop-lead::after`, so it is punctuation in the stylesheet rather
     than nine copies of it in the copy. */

     THE TYPE'S OWN FIELDS, AS CONTROLS

     Everything in `o.x` was read-only. Eight types' worth of facts that the
     card renders, the document renders and the rail read aloud — a ticket's
     resolution, a blog's author, a web page's URL, an ICP's fit criteria —
     and not one of them could be changed anywhere in the product. The panel's
     own rule two hundred lines up is that every property here is a control
     that writes straight through to the object; the type-specific half had
     simply never been given one.

     This REPLACES the read-only facts block that used to sit at the top of
     the panel. That block rendered these same values as phrases, so keeping
     both would put every fact on screen twice, four rows apart — once as
     prose and once as a field. The lead phrases below are the ones the facts
     block used, so nothing about how it reads has been lost.

     Four kinds, because four is what the data actually is:
       text   — a phrase. Reads as a fact, becomes an input when clicked,
                the same rule the title, the body and the custom facts follow.
       pick   — a closed set. A ticket is Resolved or it is not, and a text
                box would invite a ninth spelling of a word with four.
       number — the ICP's fit score, clamped 0-100 because it is a percentage
                and a field that accepts 900 is a field that will hold 900.
       list   — the ICP's criteria, which are SENTENCES. `tagField` cannot
                hold them: it slugs its input on Enter, so "Existing QA
                function" would be stored as "existing-qa-function".

     Ticket assignee is deliberately absent: it is edited through the Owner
     row, which is where every surface already puts whoever answers for the
     document. Two controls for one field is how they drift.

  /* ── A closed set that takes more than one answer ──

     Groups and Audience are the two fields here a document can hold several of.
     They were four and three checkboxes standing open in the rail, which was
     honest about being multi-select and wrong about everything else: seven
     always-visible rows in a column of nine facts, so two fields took a third
     of the panel, and neither read like the seven fields above it. A rail of
     rows should be a rail of rows.

     So: the same trigger, the same panel position, the same lead-and-value
     shape as every dropdown on this panel — with checkboxes inside instead of
     options, because the answer is a set.

     It cannot BE a `.v2-dropdown`. That class is behaviour, not looks:
     aimy-ds.js binds every `.v2-dropdown-btn` and every `.v2-dropdown-option`
     on the page, and `choose()` is strictly single-select — it clears every
     other selection, writes one label and closes the panel. A second tick
     would undo the first. `.k-date` reached the same conclusion for the
     calendar and is the precedent this follows: own classes, own open state,
     visual rule mirrored from the same tokens, recorded in GAPS.md.

     What that buys, besides not fighting the library: the rows are real
     `<input type="checkbox">` in real `<label>`s, so Tab walks them and Space
     ticks them without a keyboard model of our own.

     The trigger NAMES rather than counts. "2 selected" is a control describing
     itself; "QA Reviewers +1" says one true thing and how much more there is.
     Empty is *None* — the same word the dropdowns use, because a field with
     nothing in it is a fact and a dash is a shrug. */

     three lines with a comma stranded at x=296 of 320 and a full stop starting
     the last line — and an open panel landed on the words after it.

     So: one fact per row, the phrase and its value together, and the whole row
     is the control. The lead sits inside the trigger, which means one hit
     target per fact, a scannable left edge, no flow, no punctuation to orphan,

     THE EIGHT VIEWS — §6.3, wired

     The library's spec is eight templates over one fixed governance row, and
     for the life of this prototype the document honoured the second half only:
     ONE template, no type dispatch, and the type's own facts rendered as a
     read-only sentence in the head while the fields holding them sat in a
     320px rail behind a closed <details>. A Ticket without its resolution in
     front of you is useless; an ICP whose disqualifiers are three clicks away
     is misleading. So the record leads, per type, and it is editable where it
     leads.

     What is CONSTANT is §6.4's list and it deliberately does not appear here:
     the topbar, the notice, the byline (status · type · owner · updated ·
     source · collection), the title, the AiMY proposal, the comments and the
     rail's foot. Someone scanning mixed types must not have to relearn where
     trust lives. This table declares only what §6.4 calls variable.

     Two invariants, both checkable:

       · ONE FACT, ONE CONTROL. A TYPE_FIELDS key renders as its editable row
         in `fields` and nowhere else. `facts` carries only what is DERIVED,
         which is also the texture channel — a ruled quote does not read like a
         row of tags, which does not read like a monospace URL — because type
         is carried by shape and never by colour.

       · WHERE PROSE LEADS, NOTHING COMES BETWEEN THE TITLE AND THE BODY. The
         head exists because status used to interrupt the only two editable
         blocks on the page; a structured block dropped in there would be the
         same defect wearing a new name.

     The canvas held exactly one conversation and it existed only as DOM: turns

     for "page position, filters, selected scope, conversation history" on
     return, and only the first three were ever kept.

     EACH SESSION CARRIES ITS SURFACE. `state` is the query string the
     conversation was had on, and the switch handler lays it back over the URL
     — so picking a conversation moves the page behind it to what that
     conversation was about. That is the whole claim: a session is not a
     transcript, it is a place you were.

     Ported from AiMY Sales, which is where this was first built.

  /* ══ WHO IS ANSWERING ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
     A conversation used to carry no record of which agent held it, because
     there was only ever one and the app said so in its chrome. The gate lists
     conversations from several side by side, and at that point "which one was
     this?" stops being answerable from the title — two threads about a refund
     read identically whether Knowledge or QA answered them.

     So the agent is a field, and the row prints it. Not an icon: a logo beside
     a title is a second thing to learn before the list can be read, and the
     word is already the shortest unambiguous form of itself.

     `id` matches the ecosystem tab it belongs to. `blurb` is what the picker
     shows underneath the name — one line, no marketing.

     ONE PER TAB. The registry is the product strip, so a conversation can
     carry whichever console held it. Only AiMY has a chat gate; the rest are
     consoles, and a thread held in one of them arrives here already labelled.
     This build holds one corpus — AiMY's
     — and an agent that can only answer from somebody else's material by
     pretending it is its own is a label on a wrong answer. Both already link
     out to their own deployments from the tab strip, which is the honest place
     for them until their corpora are here.

     What the three below split is not subject matter but the QUESTION each is
     good at: prose and policy, the health of the corpus, and its shape. Each
     one's suggestions were run against the answer engine and kept only where
     the answer came back grounded. */

     by construction and choosing was a decision nobody had to make.

     The field survives the picker because the LIST spans the ecosystem: a

     THE STORE — what was said, not what is shown

     README declared, twice, that conversations do not survive a reload and
     that nothing in the build pretends otherwise. This closes that, and both
     passages are rewritten in the same change rather than left standing.

     ── The one hard part ──
     A turn's `html` may be a FUNCTION. Live answers are stored as closures and
     re-run by `canvas.repaint()`, which is how an answer citing "5 sources, 2
     failing" corrects itself after you fix a source. Functions do not
     serialize, and `JSON.stringify` drops them silently — the failure would be
     a thread that restores looking perfect and is quietly dead.

     So a live turn persists its QUESTION and is rehydrated as a fresh closure
     over `answerFor`. What comes back is not a photograph of the answer; it is
     the answer, recomputed against the corpus as it stands now.

     ── What it deliberately is not ──
     `knowledge.js` states the doctrine for this: "None of this is a second
     source of truth. The URL still decides everything on screen." The store
     holds what was SAID. It never holds what is displayed, never restores a
     scroll position, and never decides which conversation is open — `?chat=`
     still does that, alone.

  /* ══ CONVERSATIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST ══════════════════════════════════

     The column could only ever show what you had asked in this tab, so it
     opened empty on every load — and the one thing it exists for, going back
     to a conversation, could be neither demonstrated nor used. A workbench
     somebody has been working in has a history behind it; starting from none
     is the state a product is in for its first five minutes and never again.

     EACH ONE CARRIES ITS SURFACE, and every `state` is built by the product's
     own serializer from objects the corpus actually holds — never written out
     by hand. A fixture cannot then outlive the document it names, drift from
     the URL format, or land you on a filter that matches nothing.

     The five between them cover what a restore has to put back: a filter set,
     an open document, a view and its grouping, a query with a date window, and
     a flag. If switching conversations only restored some of that, one of
     these would show it.

     "hi" is not a question about the corpus. Put through the grounding path it
     produced the right answer to the wrong question — *nothing in the corpus
     grounds an answer to that* — which is true, and is not what a person
     saying hello has asked. So it is handled before the shape and topic
     matchers, because it is not a retrieval problem at all.

     ── The greeting is the whole message ──
     `hi` is greeted; `hi, which documents are out of date?` is ANSWERED. A
     greeting used as a preamble is not a request to be greeted, and matching
     on a prefix would swallow the question riding behind it.

     ── What makes this more than a greeting ──
     The suggestions are not a fixed list. They are chosen from what is
     actually sitting with this person, ranked by `needScore` — the product's
     own definition of what needs someone, already behind the landing set and
     the Needs-attention sort. A second definition of "your work" is how the
     two start disagreeing about it.

     ── Why these questions always resolve ──
     Each suggestion is a bare SHAPE question: every word in it is a stop word
     or a shape word, so `questionScope` drops them all, returns the full pool
     with `broad: true`, and `COMPUTED[shape]` always has something to answer
     from. Suggestion chips that resolved to "nothing grounds an answer" have
     shipped here before — these cannot, by construction rather than by
     having been checked once. */

     THE DRAWERS

     Two surfaces used to be deleted on a narrow screen: the briefing rail
     below 1040px, and the canvas's conversation column below 900px, both by
     `display: none`. Neither is decoration — the rail IS this product's
     information architecture, and the column is the only way to reach a
     different conversation. A layout that cannot change size can only change
     what it drops, and dropping those two is dropping the product's two
     entry points.

     They are drawers now. The CSS does the showing; this does the state, and
     the four things a drawer owes you beyond opening:

       · Escape closes it, and only it — the guard checks `open` first, so this
         does not eat the Escape that closes the canvas or the block menu.
       · Focus goes in on open and comes back to the button on close. A drawer
         you can open from the keyboard and not read from it is worse than no
         drawer.
       · Acting on a row closes it. Every item in the briefing is a FILTER
         LINK — it sets the surface's state rather than navigating — so leaving
         the drawer covering the result you just asked for hides the answer.
       · Widening past the breakpoint closes it. Otherwise `is-open` survives
         into a layout where the rail is a column again and the scrim is still
         over the page, with nothing left on screen to dismiss it.

       control that does not work, which is exactly how it was reported.

       writing its own copy of the value. Enter blurs, and blur commits.
       Escape puts the stored value back FIRST, so the commit its blur triggers
       is a no-op and the field returns to the state it opened in. One writer,
       three ways in, and no chance of the three drifting apart.

       Escape is capture-phase and stops there. Without the guard the same

  /* ══ THE TYPEWRITER ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     A reveal, not a stream. There is no backend, so the whole answer exists
     before the first character is shown — and saying otherwise in the UI would
     be the kind of theatre this repo avoids elsewhere.

     Three constraints the surrounding code imposes, all of them load-bearing:

     1. `turn.html` is written in full BEFORE this runs. A rebuild renders from
        the turn, so a half-typed string must never be written back or
        switching away and back would freeze the answer mid-word.
     2. The element can leave the DOM mid-reveal — switching conversation
        removes it — so every tick re-checks that it is still connected.
     3. It mutates INSIDE the bubble. chat.js observes the thread with
        `childList` only, deliberately, so that the answer swap does not fire
        it per character; writing to the bubble keeps that guarantee.

     Character-by-character on HTML would tear tags open, so it reveals by
     BLOCK — the answer's own top-level children, which is also how a person
     reads it. */
  /* ══ THE STREAM ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     The first version appended whole blocks every 90ms, which is not a stream
     — it is a slideshow, and a 90ms step is visible as a step. This advances
     on the frame clock and reveals CHARACTERS, so the rate is continuous and
     the motion is whatever the display can draw.

     ── Why not simply type the HTML ──
     The answer is markup, not prose: cutting a string of it at an arbitrary
     index tears tags open. So the markup is inserted intact and the TEXT NODES
     are emptied and refilled. The structure is always valid; only how much of
     it has been said changes.

     ── Prose streams, structure arrives ──
     Typing out a status badge or a source row character by character reads as
     a machine filling in a form. Those blocks are revealed whole, with a short
     fade; only prose is streamed. Both are on the same clock, so the answer
     still assembles at one pace.

     ── 1100 characters a second ──
     Fast enough not to be a wait, slow enough to read as arriving. Measured
     against the answers this corpus actually produces: the refund answer runs
     about 1.4s, which is close to how long it takes to read the first line. */

       requestAnimationFrame does not run in a backgrounded tab, so switching
       away mid-stream would freeze the text where it stood and leave it there
       on return — a truncated answer that reads as the product having stopped
       mid-sentence. It also does not run at all in this repo's review pane.

       So the frame clock is an optimisation, not the contract: a timer sized
       to twice the expected duration finishes the answer outright if the
       frames never came. setTimeout is throttled in a background tab but it

  /* ══ THE CITATION HOVERCARD LEAVES THE THREAD ══════════════════════════
     `.cite-preview` is written as a child of its `.cite-wrap`, and every way
     that card has broken traces back to that one fact:

       · the thread scrolls, so `overflow-x` computes to `auto` and the card is
         CLIPPED whenever a citation sits within half a card-width of an edge;
       · a `transform` or `filter` anywhere above it makes that ancestor the
         containing block, so `position: fixed` stops meaning the viewport and
         the card lands offset by however far that ancestor is from the corner;
       · the stylesheet anchors it with `bottom`, so adding a `top` leaves the
         box over-constrained and the height resolves from the offsets instead
         of the content.

     Positioning it in place fixes those one at a time and leaves the next one
     waiting. Moving it out fixes the category: on open the card is reparented
     to `<body>`, where nothing clips and nothing can be a containing block but
     the viewport, and on close it goes home. `document.body` is the only
     element in the page guaranteed to be neither.

     This file already recorded the diagnosis — "it is `position: absolute`
     against a `.cite-wrap` parent … needs fixed positioning", filed in
     GAPS.md. This is the whole of that fix.

     THE TRANSFORM IS LEFT ALONE. The stylesheet centres the card with
     `translateX(-50%)` and TRANSITIONS transform, so writing `none` starts an
     animation rather than setting a value — for its duration the card sits
     half its width to the left. The offset is added back into `left` instead,
     so the untouched -50% lands the edge exactly where it was asked to go. */

       So: display it while it is still transparent, force the reflow, measure
       and place it, and only then add `is-open`. Setting `is-open` first — as
       this did — meant the browser had never rendered a frame at opacity 0,
       so there was no start value to animate from and the card appeared fully
       formed. Same two declarations, opposite result, purely from which side
       of the reflow they fall on.

     One line, once, at boot. Not decoration: this prototype is iterated by

     THINKING — the mark, dispersed and reformed

     Three dots said "something is happening" and nothing else. This says who
     is doing it: the AiMY mark scatters into an orbit, holds there while the
     corpus is searched, and gathers back into itself.

     ── Sampled, not hand-plotted ──
     The mark is one <path>. Rather than rasterise it to a canvas and read
     pixels back — which needs an image load, and taints the canvas on some
     configurations, `file://` among them — the path is handed to `Path2D` and
     candidate points are tested with `isPointInPath`. Pure geometry: no image,
     no decode, no taint, and it works from a local file.

     ── Cheap on purpose ──
     Sampling runs ONCE, lazily, on the first answer. The loop runs only while
     a placeholder is on screen and stops the moment its canvas leaves the DOM,
     so nothing is burning frames between questions. About 90 points at 26px —
     the reference uses 300 at 64px, and past a point more dots at this size is
     just grey.
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════ */
  /* ══ THE MARK'S OWN COLOURS ════════════════════════════════════════════
     The logo is not one colour: it is a radial gradient running violet at the
     centre out to blue at the rim. A single flat fill throws that away, and
     the scatter is the one moment the gradient is legible as a gradient —
     ninety dots each holding their own stop, spread out where the artwork
     usually packs them into a 26px mark.

     READ FROM THE <radialGradient> IN THE PAGE, not copied here. The stops,
     the centre and the radius all come off the element the logo itself paints
     with, so a rebrand moves this with it and cannot leave the two disagreeing.

     A dot keeps the colour of the petal it CAME FROM, rather than taking one
     from wherever it currently floats. The alternative reads as a colour wheel
     the dots pass through; this reads as the mark coming apart and back
     together, which is the thing being said. */
