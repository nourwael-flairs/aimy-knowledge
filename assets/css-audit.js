   css-audit.js — every class the product renders must resolve to a rule.

   This exists because a bulk deletion once cut a CSS range between two
   section markers without checking what was inside it, and took the editor,
   the drop layer, the status override and the conflict blocks with it. The
   page still loaded, nothing threw, and the damage was only visible to
   somebody looking at the screen.

   A missing rule is not a runtime error, so no error trap will find it.
   This will.

       node assets/css-audit.js

   Exits non-zero if any class rendered by knowledge.js, chat.js or index.html
   has no rule in knowledge.css, chat.css, settings.css or aimy-ds.css -- and
   for spacing, type, ink and token faults in knowledge.css and chat.css.

/* ── Spacing ──

   The library declares a 4px scale (`--sp-1…--sp-15`) and says in its own
   documentation: "No hard-coded colors or spacing in product code." An audit
   found 62% of this product's spacing off that scale — thirteen different gap
   values, chosen a component at a time over many rounds, which is exactly what
   uneven rhythm looks like from the inside.

   The scale used here is the library's plus the two dense steps it does not
   have — 2 and 6 — because a 4→8 jump is 100% and small controls need
   something between. The library's own components prove the need: it uses 6px
   42 times and 10px 67 times. Recorded in GAPS.md.

   Above 60 anything on an 8px grid passes: those are layout offsets, not
   rhythm — clearing a fixed input, not spacing two labels. */

   Same reasoning as spacing, and the same history: the library declares
   --fs-2xs...--fs-5xl and then uses it zero times -- 265 literal sizes in
   aimy-ds.css, 55% off its own scale, clustered at the small end (8, 8.5, 9,
   9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5). Twenty-six distinct sizes existed across this repo
   against an eleven-step declared scale. A scale that is declared and not
   enforced is a suggestion.

   The check is on the TOKEN, not the value, and that is deliberate: --ty-title
   and --ty-body re-point inside panels, so a rule saying `15px` is right on one
   surface and wrong on the other, while a rule saying var(--ty-body) is right
   on both. Checking values would make the density scale unexpressible.

   --fs-* is banned outright. It is the library's PAGE scale, and reaching for
   it is how 10px arrives without anybody having decided on 10px.

   Exempt a line with an `scale-ok:` comment on it or above it, and say why.

   ON `gate-`: it is deliberately NOT in OUT_OF_SCOPE. The chat prefixes below

   five label classes were moved onto --d500 on the strength of it. This is the
