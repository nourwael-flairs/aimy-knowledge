   settings.js — AiMY Settings

   A page, not a fourth overlay. The corpus already carries the canvas, the
   settings sheet and the peek; settings is somewhere you GO, and giving it a
   URL is what makes it linkable, bookmarkable and drivable by an agent.

   ── The IA ──
   The production console splits at the top by WHO (Personal | Workspace
   Admin). That forces every capability to exist twice and reduces the whole
   override story to a banner sentence plus a padlock. This build splits by
   WHAT, and demotes "whose" to a LENS that sits across every module:

       AI Controls   what AiMY can do        Skills, Agents, Grounding
       Organization  who exists and reaches  People, Roles, Hierarchy, Plan
       Operations    the machinery           Sync, Webhooks, Mapping, ...

       Lens          Yours | Organization | Effective     (default Effective)

   So Skills is ONE destination. Your skills and the organisation's are in one
   list, each saying where it came from and whether it survived.

   ── Instructions are skills ──
   They were a separate object with their own module. They are the same thing:
   an instruction is a skill that ALWAYS applies. `trigger: 'always'` is the
   whole of the merge, and the four old RULES fixtures come across with their
   scope, their reach and their state intact. This reverses the position
   argued in the previous build of this file; it was a deliberate call, not an
   oversight.

   ── State ──
   The query string, same as the corpus. Nothing narrows the view off a
   variable the URL does not also hold, because a filter with neither a control
   nor a chip has silently taken something away.

  /* ═══ PRECEDENCE ═══
     THE SIX-LEVEL LADDER IS GONE, AND SO IS THE MACHINERY THAT RESOLVED IT.

     `LEVELS`, `resolve()`, `ladder()`, `chainSpeaks()`, `lensNothing`, the
     three-way lens and every skill's six-entry `chain` stood here. They
     described precedence as a walk down the tenancy — Organisation, Client,
     Business Unit, Product, Team, You — with a lock that could stop the walk
     early.

     Two things killed it. Reach became agents × products, which are not levels
     of that tenancy, so the ladder was resolving a hierarchy nothing else on
     the surface used any more; that contradiction was flagged on screen rather
     than settled. And Nour settled it: the organisation's skills override
     yours when they overlap. That is a rule about WHO OWNS a skill, not about
     how deep in a tree it was set, and it needs two parties rather than six
     stops.

     Also removed on the way out: the Effective / Organization / Yours lens.
     It read and wrote `lens` correctly, but `.set2-lens` and `.set2-lens-b`
     were never written in `settings.css`, so it rendered as three unstyled
     words. Its `lens` key leaves `knowledge.js` with it — a URL parameter no

     CONNECTIONS

     The console models this surface as four unrelated sections stacked on one
     scroll, scoped by two dropdowns that sit in different places and mean
     different things: a product picker in the page chrome ("FileBound") and a
     CRM picker in a section header ("CRM"). A third copy of the product,
     disabled, sits inside the sync form. Nothing on the page says that all
     four sections describe ONE thing.

     They do. A product plus a CRM is a CONNECTION, and everything else here
     is that connection's contract: what its fields mean, how far back to
     read, when to pull, and what to throw away. So the scope stops being two
     dropdowns and becomes a list you pick from, the way Supabase and Railway
     scope a project. You are never in a state where the page is showing you
     one product's mapping and another product's sync.

     THE DATE RANGE, IN OUR OWN CALENDAR

     Both ends were `<input type="date">`. The browser draws that control
     itself, in its own colours, at its own size, in the OS's locale — so on a
     dark settings page it opened a white sheet reading `08/01/2026` in
     month-first order, which is the one date format this product uses nowhere
     else. It was also the only control on the surface whose look nobody here
     could change.

     `.cal` is the design system's month calendar and it is used unchanged:
     head with two nav buttons, seven-column grid, `.muted` / `.today` /
     `.selected`. The RANGE states — `in-range`, `range-start`, `range-end` —
     are the product extension knowledge.js already added for the corpus date
     filter and recorded in GAPS.md; this is the second consumer of them, not a
     second copy.

     WHY NOT REUSE knowledge.js's WHOLE CALENDAR. Its model is days-before-
     today: every date it handles is an offset, it refuses the future because
     nothing in the corpus has one, and it writes a filter key. A sync range is
     two absolute dates with neither of those properties. Sharing the CSS is
     sharing what is genuinely the same; sharing the controller would mean
     bending one model around the other.

     ONE COMPONENT, NOT TWO PICKERS. It was two boxes, each opening this same
     panel "for its end" — and the panel drew the whole range regardless, so it
     was neither two date pickers nor one range picker. It was one range picker
     wearing two triggers, which meant the thing on screen could not tell you
     what it was: a range highlighted across a month, opened from a box that
     claimed to own one end of it.

     A range is one value. So it is one trigger, one panel, and two clicks: the
     first sets an end, the second closes the range. And because the component
     owns both ends, it ORDERS them — click the later day first and it is still
     a range that runs forwards. A backwards range is not an error to be caught
     here, it is a state this control can no longer express. */

     The previous build split by what a thing IS (AI Controls / Organization /

     still stands and this does not reopen it: Client and Admin is not the same
     capability under two owners — no module appears in both groups. It is the
     same WHAT split, ordered by whose job it is, which is the question someone
     opening settings is actually asking.

     `scope: 'conn'` marks the five facets of one connection. They are separate
     rail items because the brief asks for them separately, but they share one
     scope key (`?conn=`) so moving between them never silently re-points you at
     a different connector — which was the whole of the earlier objection to
     splitting mapping from sync, and it is answered by the scope, not by the

     THE PRODUCTION TOOLBAR, AND CLAUDE'S DOCUMENT.

     Two references, and they answer different halves.

     PRODUCTION owns the LIST: `All agents` and `All products` beside a name
     search, `Download example` and `New Skill` on the right, and a sortable
     Name / Description / Status table under it. That is what a skill is
     filtered by in the real console, so it is what the list does here.

     CLAUDE owns the DOCUMENT: a back link, the name with its author under it,
     an enable toggle and an overflow at the right, and two tabs — `Overview`
     and `Contents · n`. Overview is the description on the left with a card on
     the right saying how the skill fires; Contents is the file itself with a
     rendered/source toggle in its corner.

     ── WHAT REPLACED WHAT ──
     The build before this was a two-pane library whose left column expanded
     into PARTS: Instructions, Precedence, Reach. Three of those clicks existed
     to reach three facts, and two of the facts are one line each. Claude's
     answer is better and simpler: everything about the skill except its text
     is in Overview, and the text is Contents.

     ── REACH IS AGENTS × PRODUCTS ──
     It was a six-level tree picker over the tenancy — clients, business units,
     products, teams, individual users. Production targets two things: which
     AGENT runs the skill and which PRODUCT it belongs to, and its products are
     knowledge domains (General, Support, Sales, Dev, UI…) rather than the
     tenancy's products. Two multi-selects, and the tree stops being involved.

     ── AND PRECEDENCE IS ON NOTICE ──
     Production has no chain, no lens, no override. The six-level ladder in
     this file was authored here and is the one thing on the surface no
     competitor has, so it survives as a third tab rather than being deleted in
     passing — but it now describes a hierarchy that reach no longer uses, and
     that is a contradiction somebody has to settle rather than inherit.

     across three pages: a grant is a ROLE on a SCOPE held by a PERSON, and you
     cannot check whether it is right while looking at only one of the three.

     A card per person, each carrying its grants in full. The role name alone
     ("Super Admin") is the half people read and the scope is the half that
     matters, so the two are never separated: `Super Admin` on `Product
     InterFAX Support` is a different grant from the same role on the
     organisation, and a list that prints only the first is lying by omission.

     NO ROLE / STATUS / ACCESS FILTERS IN THIS PASS. They belong on this
     surface and the screenshot has them, but a filter has to write to the URL
     to be honest here, and a dropdown that narrows nothing is the exact defect
     this file spent a paragraph removing from the old filter row. Five people
     do not need them; fifty will, and they arrive with their query keys. */

  /* ══ PEOPLE ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ANCHORED TO A SCOPE, NOT TO THE DIRECTORY.

     This replaces a grid of one card per person. The cards were not the
     problem — a grant really is a nested structure a table row cannot hold —
     but their height was the roster, and this workspace is an MSP with ten
     clients and fourteen products under Upland alone. Five cards is a page;
     five hundred is a scroll with no question at the top of it.

     So the page asks a scope and answers who reaches it. InterFAX Support has
     two people whether the company has fifty staff or five thousand.

     ── THE SPLIT IS THE POINT ──
     Everyone who reaches a node arrives one of two ways, and a flat roster
     prints them identically:

       GRANTED HERE          the grant names this node. Revocable in place.
       INHERITED FROM ABOVE  the grant names an ancestor. NOT revocable here —
                             you have to go up to where it was written.

     Drawing that is the difference between a revocation that works and one
     that silently does nothing, which is the failure a flat list invites: you
     press Revoke on Nour at InterFAX, the grant lives on Upland, and either
     nothing happens or you quietly cut her out of thirteen other products.

     ── THE ROOT IS EVERYONE ──
     Two things have no scope: inviting somebody, and holding nothing. Both
     live at the root, which is not "the organisation" as a place so much as
     the directory. It splits three ways instead of two — organisation-wide,
     scoped below, and no access — which makes the two facts an admin audits
     for into groups rather than a warning in a lede.

     ── WHAT MOVED, NOT WHAT WENT ──
     One person's COMPLETE access no longer has a card of its own. It has two
     homes instead: the root lists every grant they hold as chips you can jump
     through, and search — which is global, and deliberately ignores the scope
     — finds them from anywhere and does the same. Editing a grant happens
     where it applies, which is the whole argument for the shape.

     it. So this is that component — `.set2-scope-pick`, kind label, bold
     value, caret — one per level, exactly as Dynamic fields draws Client and
     Product.

     The org is static text, again as over there: Connections starts its
     pickers at Client because the organisation is not a choice. Neither is it
     here.

     The trailing picker is how you go DEEPER, and it is the same control in
     its unset state — `Team · All` rather than a second idiom for descending.

     It used to FADE while searching. Search is global here on purpose, so the
     header would otherwise say `InterFAX Support` over results drawn from the
     whole workspace — the scope has not moved, it just is not what you are
     reading from. Fading it said that by making the breadcrumb you need to get
     back the least readable thing on the page at the moment you are lost in
     it. The line below it already says the search is global, in words. */

  /* ══ ROLES ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ONE ROLE AT A TIME, AND COMPARISON AS A DELTA.

     This replaces a six-by-twelve matrix. The matrix was honest about being a
     reference and said so under itself, but it was wrong about which axis
     grows. Six roles is a settled number — even a custom-role feature keeps it
     in the low tens. CAPABILITIES are what grow: twelve here, and fifty to two
     hundred in any RBAC surface that has been in production a while. At fifty
     the grid is six hundred cells with a horizontal scrollbar, and the reader
     is counting columns to find out what Admin can do.

     So the matrix is never rendered. A bounded list picks a role; the page
     shows capabilities against THAT ONE, which is `n` rows and not `n × 6`.

     ── COMPARISON IS THE HARD PART, AND A DELTA IS THE ANSWER ──
     Losing the grid loses side-by-side, which was the one thing it was good
     at. Rendering the DIFFERENCE gets it back and survives the growth that
     killed the grid: Admin differs from Super Admin in four capabilities, and
     that sentence is exactly as readable at four of two hundred. The eight
     that match collapse to one line, because "these are the same" is a fact
     that needs stating once rather than eight times.

     ── THE OTHER READING ──
     A role answers "what can Admin do". Nobody asks only that. The other
     question is "who can delete synced records", which the matrix answered by
     making you find a row and read across six columns. Searching a capability
     flips the page to answer it directly — same data, second reading, no
     second page.

     ── AND IT WRITES NOW ──
     This shipped as a reference and said so twice, because the matrix it
     replaced had seventy-two cells a client admin could click and get nothing
     from. That was honest about a table that could not be edited; it was never
     an argument that roles should not be editable, and they are.

     A capability is set on its own row, from the page of the role it belongs
     to — which is the reason the one-role-at-a-time shape came first. The
     compared column stays a label: two editable columns on one row is a
     surface where it is not obvious which role you just changed.

     `lock` is the exception and is the reason the state exists. It marks the
     capabilities that could not be granted BACK from inside the product if
     every admin gave them up, so those rows carry the padlock rather than the
     control — a switch there would be a door that locks behind you.

  /* ══ SCOPES ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     A MAP, BECAUSE THE TENANCY IS NOT THE SAME SHAPE TWICE.

     This replaces an indented tree. A tree renders every branch as the same
     shape at the same width, and the tenancy is nothing like that: CXS runs
     all six levels, Upland stops at Product on most of what it owns, MedFar is
     a client with nothing under it at all — the state the picker most often
     gets wrong and the state most real clients are in. Indentation flattens
     that unevenness away. A map is made of it.

     And this tree is not a page. It is the spine: grants resolve through it,
     skills target it, connections hang off its products. It showed names and
     one total. Selecting a node now says what depends on it, all of it read
     back out of `PEOPLE.grants`, `SEL` and `CONNECTIONS` — the map is the
     first surface that asks those three the same question.

     ── IT NEVER DRAWS EVERYTHING ──
     The rule the other three modules were rebuilt under applies hardest here,
     because a canvas fails at scale more expensively than a list does. Ten
     clients and thirty products would be a wall of boxes.

       DEPTH   stops at Product. Team and User roll up into a count on the
               node above them, and open per branch when asked.
       BREADTH `SIB_CAP` siblings, then "+n more" — Upland owns fourteen
               products in the console and drawing them is a column of
               fourteen boxes nobody reads.

     That is also the answer to the six-columns-of-boxes problem: drawn to full
     depth this is a tree lying on its side, which is worse than the tree it
     replaced. Four levels wide, the rest in the inspector.

     ── READ-ONLY, STILL ──
     Nothing here edits the hierarchy. Expanding, searching and selecting are
     the whole of it. "Create client" is not back: it left because it had no
     handler, and a canvas does not make that less true.

  /* ══ FIVE FACETS OF ONE CONNECTION ═════════════════════════════════════
     A product plus a CRM is a CONNECTION, and Config, Sync, Failures,
     Knowledge enablement and APIs are five things you do to one. The console
     modelled this as unrelated sections scoped by two dropdowns that sat in
     different places and meant different things — a product picker in the page
     chrome and a CRM picker in a section header, with a third disabled copy of
     the product inside the sync form.

     Here the scope is ONE control in the module header, and it is shared state
     (`?conn=`). Moving from Config to Sync cannot silently re-point you at a
     different connector, which was the real objection to separating them.

     With nothing picked you get the list, headed by what you are about to do
     with it. Nobody meets an empty page and nobody meets a page scoped to
     something they did not choose. */

  /* ── The scope, as one control in the chrome ──
     Picked once and carried. It reads as a sentence about where you are, with
     exactly one thing in it you can change — which is the shape the design
     uses and the reason nothing below it has to ask again. */
  /* ── THE CONNECTOR COUNT AND THE HEALTH PILL ARE GONE FROM THE CHROME ──
     "2 connectors · 1 not connected" rode the scope bar on all four pages that
     use it. Removed from Dynamic fields first, then from the rest, on the same
     test applied page by page.

     It could not name the connector. That is the whole case against it: a red
     pill saying one of two is down, on a page whose own connector picker lists
     BOTH BY NAME WITH THEIR HEALTH AS THE CAPTION (see `data-crm-pick`), warns
     you about something the page states better two inches away — and states it
     in the one place you cannot act on it.

     Page by page: on Dynamic fields it sat over a table of fields that were all
     fine and read as a warning about them. On Sync every run in the history is
     tagged with its connector and its outcome, and `Test sync` is right there.
     On Data relevance the rows ARE the connectors, each named, and a retention
     threshold does not care whether a token is live. On Enablement the rail
     already says "1 endpoint down" with a Reconnect beside it, which is the
     same fact carrying the action this pill never had.

     The `No products connected` case stays. That one is not a count, it is the
     reason the page below is empty. */
  /* ── AND THE THIRD LEVEL, WHICH WAS ALREADY THE SCOPE ──
     `?crm=` has been module-wide state since Config and Sync merged: it picks
     which connector's fields the mapping table shows, which connector's
     criteria the trigger form edits, and which one Run sync starts. It was
     spelled out twice in two section headers and nowhere in the chrome, so the
     page had two pickers for one fact and no line saying where you were
     standing — the exact defect the client and product pair was fixed for.

     It is called DATA SOURCE rather than CRM because two of the five are not
     CRMs and never were: a website crawl and a folder of uploaded files answer
     for this product too. The console names the same axis the same way, and an
     axis with two names is two axes to everybody except the person who built
     it.

     The bar reads whose it is, what it answers for, and where that came from —
     Client › Product › Data Source — narrowing left to right, which is the
     order the console's filter row puts the same three in. */

     between two connectors is what their fields are called. How far back to
     read is a question about answering, which the product does once.

     So this reads every connector on the product. Where they agree there is
     one number; where they do not, the disagreement is the news and the
     control says so rather than picking a winner. */
  /* ── DATA RELEVANCE RANGE ──
     Built to the frame: the section's own title and sentence, the label
     "Retrieve data from the past:", and ONE control carrying the number and
     its unit together. It was a bare number box with a "days" suffix beside
     it, which reads as two things to set instead of one thing to pick.

     A select, not free text: the horizons that matter are a short list, and
     typing 1..3650 into a box invites a number nobody meant. The product-level
     scope stays -- this is a question about answering, which the product does
     once, so it reads every connector and says so when they disagree. */
  const RELEVANCE = [7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365];

  /* ── DAYS, AS THE SYSTEM'S OWN SELECT ──

     Both of this page's sections ask for a number of days and each had reached
     for a different platform control: a native `<select>` on the range and a
     `<input type="number">` on the threshold. Two shapes for one question, and
     neither of them ours — a native select paints its own list in the OS's
     colours and a number spinner puts two 8px arrows inside the field, which
     is the sliver of chrome in the screenshot that started this.

     `.v2-dropdown` is the design system's only select control, and it already
     carries what a custom listbox owes: keyboard navigation, typeahead, focus
     management, and the ARIA that makes it announce as a listbox. Nothing here
     re-implements any of that — this builds the markup its controller expects
     and listens for the `dd:change` it emits.

     A THRESHOLD BECOMES A CHOICE. The retention field took any integer from 1
     to 3650. In practice a retention policy is chosen from a shortlist, not
     dialled in, and the free number was buying arbitrary precision at the cost
     of a control nobody could use with a keyboard without also being able to
     see a spinner. The list is the same one the range uses, because "how long
     do we keep this" and "how far back do we read" are measured on one scale. */

  /* ── ONE CONTROL PER CONNECTOR, LIKE THE SECTION BELOW IT ──

     This was a single select governing every connector at once, on the
     reasoning that "how far back to read" is a question the PRODUCT answers
     once. Two rewrites tried to make that work and both failed on the same
     rock: the connectors in the fixture disagree, so the one control had no
     honest value to show. First it showed `Math.min` and drew a change nobody
     had asked for; then it showed "Mixed", which is a control admitting it
     cannot answer its own question and putting the reader in front of a
     dropdown whose only real option is "overwrite both".

     A range IS per connector — the model has always stored it that way — and
     Trigger delete directly below has had one threshold per CRM from the
     start. So this is that: same card, same row, same control slot, same unit.
     Two sections that ask "how much history" answer it in one shape, and a
     disagreement between connectors stops being an exception the layout has to
     apologise for. It is just two rows with two values.

     The middle column is the consequence, where Retention puts its record
     count: the date the range actually reaches back to. A number of days is a
     setting; the date is what it means. */

     Several at once, because adding a team is the common case and doing it one

     ── INLINE, NOT A MODAL ──
     It was a button in the section head that opened a dialog: addresses, then
     an optional role, then an optional scope. Three decisions to get one
     address in, and the two optional ones were the very act the card offers a
     moment later with "+ Grant a role" — so the dialog asked for the same
     thing twice, once blind and once in place. The frame puts one field at the
     top of the list with a Send beside it, and the frame is right: the field
     takes addresses, Enter or a comma adds another, Send does the lot, and the
     roles are granted where the person is.

     THREE FIELDS, IN A SHEET.

     This replaces a tag field that took email addresses and nothing else. It
     was the better shape for what it did — paste twelve addresses, press once
     — but what it did was not enough: an invitation carries a NAME and a JOB
     TITLE as well, and the bar had nowhere to put either.

     What it did instead was guess. `nameFromMail` split the local part on
     dots and title-cased it, so `a.mahfouz@` became "A Mahfouz" and every
     record landed with the literal title "From your directory". A directory
     whose names are inferred from email addresses is one where somebody has
     to correct every row later, and the title was not a guess at all — it was
     a placeholder printed as a fact.

     So: a button and a sheet. Three fields, all required, because a record
     missing any of them is the record the bar was already producing.

     WHAT IS LOST, AND WHY THAT IS ACCEPTABLE: the paste-a-list flow. Twelve
     people is now twelve passes. That is a real cost and it buys a directory
     that does not need correcting afterwards — and bulk import belongs with

     This replaces "Sources & data" in the briefing rail. Same shape — a

     right — because that shape was already the right one: it is dense enough
     that eleven destinations fit in a rail that also has to carry a briefing.

     What it takes from QA is not the layout but the RULE: every note states
     what AiMY actually found on that surface, with the number in it. A rail
     that reads "3 sources" every day is a rail nobody reads twice. The order
     never moves, so the column can be learned as a place while what it says
     changes underneath — that is the half of QA's reasoning worth keeping.

     Sources & data is not lost, it is one level up: a source that is down now

     THE RAIL — one tree, muted labels, expandable parents

     Modelled on the Twilio console's left nav and every console that shares
     its shape: a muted group label, a parent row you can expand, one page per
     leaf, and the leaf you are on marked. The reference set is on Mobbin —
     Supabase for the label-over-children contrast step, Remote for the
     expand-to-children behaviour.

     THREE THINGS SEPARATE, and the file already had a rule for two of them:
     the GROUP is a signpost read once, the PAGE NAME is what you came to find,
     and the STATE is what the page is carrying. So the group label is quietest,
     the page name is the loudest thing in the column, and the state sits under
     it in meta. That is the same ladder `.set2-sec-t` follows on the page
     itself, and it should be — the rail is a table of contents for a surface
     that has to read as one surface.

     WHAT IS EXPANDED. Exactly one group, or none. An accordion rather than a
     set of independent drawers, and for the reason accordions exist: the rail
     also carries the briefing and a way back to chat, and three groups open at
     once pushed the last of them past the fold on a 950px window — so the
     structure this exists to show could not be seen all at once, which is the
     one thing it had to do.

     One at a time also makes the closed rows worth reading. A group's dot is
     the worst state under it, and a dot only says something when the thing it
     summarises is folded away.

     It is a preference about the chrome, so it lives here rather than in the
     URL — a link should open a page, not restore somebody else's idea of which
     drawer was pulled out. */

     PAGES — a module is a group of pages, not one page with a map

     WHAT THIS REPLACES. Connections was 2178px of five sections with a spine
     down the left gutter: a map, a reading position, and a state per section.
     The spine was a good answer to the wrong question. It made a long page
     navigable; it did not make it short. Someone who came to fix a broken
     field mapping still loaded the sync history, the retention thresholds and
     every run of both connectors to get there, and the address bar could not
     tell anyone else where they had been.

     The rail already had a list of destinations in it. The spine was a SECOND
     list of destinations, in a different place, in a different visual
     language, for the sections of whichever destination you had picked from
     the first. Merging them is not a new idea — it is what every console with
     more settings than fit on a page does, Twilio's included: one tree, muted
     group labels, expandable parents, one page per leaf.

     So these are PAGES now. Each is addressable (`?sec=`), each is one screen,
     and the rail says what is on all of them at once.

     WHAT EACH ENTRY IS. `id` addresses it, `name` is the rail row, `secs` are
     the section renderers it composes, and `state` reports what the page is
     carrying — the same computation the spine used, because it was the right
     computation and only its housing was wrong.

     `state` returns `{ note, s, fix }`. `note` and `s` are the line and the
     severity under the rail row. `fix` is what is new: the one thing worth
     doing about a bad state, named as an action rather than as a count. */

  /* ── ONE PROBLEM, NAMED AS THE ACTION THAT ENDS IT ──

     "3 broken" is a diagnosis. It says a page has something wrong on it and
     leaves you to find which row, which is the part that costs the time — and
     the old spine did that from a gutter you could only read once you were
     already on the page carrying the problem.

     A fix carries `sec` (which page) and `find` (which row on it). Arriving
     scrolls to that row and marks it, so the click lands you ON the thing
     rather than at the top of a page that contains it somewhere. */

       not what shipped.

       IT WAS WRITING INTO A ROW THAT DOES NOT EXIST. The handler reached for
       `.set2-row` / `.set2-row-d` / `.set2-from`; `secRetention` renders
       `.set2-set-row` / `.set2-set-d`. `closest` returned null, `$` falls back
       to `document` when its root is falsy, the document has no `.set2-row-d`
       either, and the assignment threw — AFTER `r.days = v` had already
       changed the model.

       So lowering Freshdesk from 90 days to 10 left the row saying "2,105
       records would go" while the confirmation it feeds said 3,976. The error
       was silent, and it was DIRECTIONAL: it always understated the damage as
       you made the threshold more destructive. On the one control here that
       cannot be undone.

       One call to `wouldDelete(r)`, one sentence, written by the same code

  /* ── A PANEL THAT OPENS INTO THE FLOOR ──

     The day picker on the last row of a card opened downward into the chat
     bar and lost its bottom options under it. The bar is `.aimy-float-wrap` at
     z-index 550; the library's panel is 200, and this file's own note on the
     z-index bands says settings surfaces sit BELOW the app-level chat
     surfaces on purpose, because those own the whole window.

     So this does not raise the panel into a band it was deliberately kept out
     of. It moves the panel instead: when there is not room beneath the
     trigger, it opens upward, and either way it is capped to the space it
     actually has. A menu that never reaches the bar cannot be covered by it,
     and the band structure is left as documented.

     THE FLOOR IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. The bar is a fixed element whose
     height depends on what is in it, so the limit is read off the element
     rather than written down as a number that goes stale the first time the
     bar grows a row.
